# The study command line

`study` is Lamplight's command line for learners and for agents with a shell. Agents
without a shell use the same operations through `study mcp`. This page is the contract
that scripts and agents can rely on. Terms follow [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `study` | Same as `study status`. |
| `study status` | Shows the Study home, the Active topic and why it was chosen, and every Topic. |
| `study topic create --title T [--id ID] [--goal G] [--dry-run]` | Creates a Topic folder with its settings, History and git repository. `--dry-run` validates and shows the result without writing. |
| `study mcp` | Runs the MCP server over stdin and stdout. |

The Study home is `STUDY_HOME` if set, otherwise `study_home` in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lamplight/config.toml`, otherwise `~/study`.

## JSON output

Every command accepts `--json`. With it, `study` prints exactly one JSON document on
stdout and nothing else; diagnostics, if any, go to stderr. `--json` is honoured even
when an earlier argument is invalid.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { "...": "the command's result" }
}
```

Failure:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "already_exists",
    "message": "a Topic named c already exists"
  }
}
```

Error codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `usage` | Unknown flag, unexpected argument, or similar command-line mistake. |
| `invalid_argument` | The request was understood but its values are invalid, such as an empty title. |
| `already_exists` | The thing to create exists already. |
| `not_found` | The thing named does not exist. |
| `newer_format` | A file was written by a newer version of `study`; upgrade to read it. |
| `internal` | Anything else, such as a file that cannot be read. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success, including empty results. |
| 1 | The command failed (`already_exists`, `not_found`, `newer_format`, `internal`). |
| 2 | Usage error (`usage`, `invalid_argument`). |

## Writes

Commands that write accept `--dry-run`, which validates the request and reports what would
change without writing anything.

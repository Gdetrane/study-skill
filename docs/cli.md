# The study command line

`study` is Lamplight's command line for learners and for agents with a shell. Agents
without a shell use the same operations through `study mcp`. This page is the contract
that scripts and agents can rely on. Terms follow [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `study` | Same as `study status`. |
| `study status` | Shows the Study home, the Active topic and why it was chosen, every Topic, and any Topic that could not be read (`problems`). A broken Topic never stops the others from being listed. |
| `study topic create --title T [--id ID] [--goal G] [--dry-run]` | Creates a Topic folder with its settings, History and git repository. `--dry-run` validates and shows the result without writing. |
| `study topic update <topic> [--title T] [--goal G] [--dry-run]` | Changes a Topic's title or goal; flags left out stay as they are, and `--goal ""` removes the goal. Settings in `topic.toml` that this version does not know are kept. The result is `{"topic": ..., "changed": bool}`: asking for the values the Topic already has changes nothing and records nothing. |
| `study topic dismiss-flag <topic> <flag-id> [--dry-run]` | Dismisses one of the Topic's flags, by the id `status` shows, once the learner has looked at it. It records the decision in the History and never changes content. The result is `{"topic": ..., "flag": {...}, "changed": bool}`; dismissing a flag twice changes nothing. Only `held_event`, `conflict`, `damaged_line` and `clock_ahead` flags can be dismissed (see below). |
| `study library build <folder>` | Indexes the books in a folder (relative to where you run it) and replaces the Library index in the Study home. |
| `study library search <query> [--limit N]` | Ranks the books in the Library against the query. `--limit` defaults to 10 and is capped at 100; no matches is a success with an empty list. |
| `study checkpoint --topic ID --role agent\|learner [-m MESSAGE] [--dry-run]` | Saves the Topic's work as a git commit at a turn switch. Skips when nothing changed, refuses during a merge or rebase, and lists large files it saved. Never runs programs named in the Topic's git configuration. It waits for a write in progress and finishes an interrupted one first; `--dry-run` refuses (`failed_precondition`) while one is pending. |
| `study doctor` | Diagnoses the setup and says how to fix what it finds. It works even when nothing else does. Exits 1 when a Finding failed. |
| `study completion install [--shell S] [--dir D] [--yes] [--dry-run]` | Installs completions for bash, zsh or fish (default: from `$SHELL`) for your user. |
| `study completion uninstall [--shell S] [--dry-run]` | Removes exactly what `install` added. |
| `study completion bash\|zsh\|fish\|powershell` | Prints a completion script, for packagers. |
| `study mcp` | Runs the MCP server over stdin and stdout. |

The Study home is `STUDY_HOME` if set, otherwise `study_home` in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lamplight/config.toml`, otherwise `~/study`. It must be an absolute path
or start with `~/`, so every folder finds the same Study home.

Global flags: `--json` (below) and `--log-level` (see [The Log](#the-log)).

Human output is styled when stdout is a terminal. Styles are dropped when it is not, and
colours are dropped with `NO_COLOR=1`; `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` keeps them in a pipe.

## JSON output

Every command accepts `--json`. With it, `study` prints exactly one JSON document on
stdout and nothing else; diagnostics, if any, go to stderr. `--json` is honoured even
when an earlier argument is invalid. Help (`--help`), `--version`, `study mcp` (which
speaks MCP on stdout) and the completion-script and man-page commands print text.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { "...": "the command's result" }
}
```

Failure:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "already_exists",
    "message": "a Topic named c already exists"
  }
}
```

Error codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `usage` | Unknown flag, unexpected argument, or similar command-line mistake. |
| `invalid_argument` | The request was understood but its values are invalid, such as an empty title. |
| `already_exists` | The thing to create exists already. |
| `not_found` | The thing named does not exist. |
| `newer_format` | A file was written by a newer version of `study`; upgrade to read it. |
| `corrupt` | A file Lamplight reads is damaged or missing, for example invalid TOML after a hand edit, or a Topic's git repository is missing, was replaced during a Checkpoint, or leads outside the Topic. Fix or restore it; the message names it. |
| `failed_precondition` | The request is valid but the Topic is not ready for it, for example a git merge is in progress or git has no identity. The message says what to do. |
| `busy` | Another program is using the Topic: another `study` process writing to it for too long, an editor using its git repository, or files that kept changing while they were being saved. Try again shortly; the message says what to do if it persists. |
| `unhealthy` | `study doctor` only: a Finding failed. `data` still holds the full diagnosis. |
| `internal` | Anything else, such as a file that cannot be read. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success, including empty results, and `study doctor` with warnings only. |
| 1 | The command failed (`already_exists`, `not_found`, `newer_format`, `corrupt`, `failed_precondition`, `busy`, `unhealthy`, `internal`). |
| 2 | Usage error (`usage`, `invalid_argument`). |

## Flags in status

Each Topic in `study status --json` may carry `flags`: things replaying its History found
that need the learner's attention. Flags are reported, never resolved automatically.

```json
{ "id": "3f9c2a71b0", "kind": "conflict", "message": "...", "item": "topic.toml", "events": ["...", "..."] }
```

| Kind | Meaning | Goes away |
|---|---|---|
| `held_event` | An Event could not be applied: it refers to something the History doesn't contain (yet), or a newer version of `study` wrote it. While a Topic holds Events from a newer version, it can be read but not changed (`newer_format`). | when the Event becomes applicable, or when dismissed |
| `conflict` | Two Events changed one item from the same version, or two different Events share an ID: usually changes made on two machines without syncing in between. | when dismissed, after checking the item by hand |
| `damaged_line` | A line of `history.jsonl` is not an Event, such as a line cut off by an interrupted write that a merge moved into the middle of the file. It is skipped, never deleted. | when the line is fixed or deleted by hand, or when dismissed |
| `clock_ahead` | The History holds an Event dated more than a day after this computer's clock, so some machine's clock was wrong. New Events still sort after it. | when the clock catches up, or when dismissed |
| `edited_outside` | Content that approves or gates progress differs from the version its last Event recorded. | when Lamplight next records that item, or the content is restored |
| `interrupted_write` | A write to the Topic was interrupted; the next write to it finishes the job. | with the next write or Checkpoint |

`id` is stable across runs and machines, so a dismissal recorded on one machine applies on
every other. `item` and `events` are present when the flag concerns a particular item or
Events.

## Writes

Commands that write accept `--dry-run`, which validates the request and reports what would
change without writing anything.

Every write to a Topic takes the Topic's lock, so the CLI and the MCP server can run at
the same time. It records its Event in the History before it changes any content, so a
write interrupted by a crash is finished by the next write or Checkpoint. A dry run reports
what the real run would do after finishing such a write, and writes nothing. Lock and
intent-marker files live in the Study home's `.lamplight/` folder, are local to the
machine, and are never synced.

## study doctor

`study doctor --json` reports a list of Findings. (A Finding is not a Check: Checks belong to
Lessons.) Each has a `status` of `ok`, `warn` or `fail`, and a `fix` for anything not `ok`.
Only a failure makes the setup unhealthy; then `ok` is `false`, the error code is
`unhealthy`, the exit code is 1, and `data` is still present:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": {
    "study_home": "/home/ada/study",
    "healthy": false,
    "findings": [
      { "name": "git", "status": "fail", "message": "git is not installed, or not on PATH",
        "fix": "install git 2.28 or newer" },
      { "name": "topic:physics", "status": "warn",
        "message": "physics is not a git repository, so Checkpoints cannot be saved",
        "fix": "git -C /home/ada/study/physics init --initial-branch=main" }
    ]
  },
  "error": { "code": "unhealthy", "message": "1 finding failed: git" }
}
```

`study_home` is absent when it cannot be resolved. Finding names, in order: `config`,
`study_home`, `git`, `git_identity` (only when git works), and, when the Study home
resolves, `local_state`, `topics`, one `topic:<id>` per Topic with a problem, and `library`;
then `log` and `completion`.

## Completions

`study completion install` writes completions for one shell, for your user only, and
records what it did in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/lamplight/completions.json` so `uninstall` can undo
exactly that:

- fish: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/completions/study.fish`. No configuration changes.
- bash: `$BASH_COMPLETION_USER_DIR/completions/study`, else
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bash-completion/completions/study`. Loaded by the bash-completion package;
  no configuration changes.
- zsh: `_study` in a writable folder already on `$fpath`. `study` cannot read zsh's `fpath`,
  so it uses `--dir` if given, else the first writable folder in an exported `FPATH`, Oh My
  Zsh's completion cache (`$ZSH_CACHE_DIR/completions`, when `$ZSH` is set), or Homebrew's
  `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/zsh/site-functions`. When none works, `study` installs to
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lamplight/completions/_study` and adds one line to `${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc`
  that sources it, but only with `--yes` or after asking at a terminal. Without consent it
  stops with a `usage` error and writes nothing.

Packages install the scripts from `study completion <shell>` system-wide instead.

## The Log

The Log is application diagnostics, never the learner's activity. Records go to two places:

- JSON lines in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/lamplight/study.log` (default
  `~/.local/state/lamplight/study.log`), at the chosen level. The file is created on the
  first record.
- stderr, formatted for people. It shows warnings and errors, or the chosen level when one
  is chosen explicitly.

The level comes from `--log-level`, else `STUDY_LOG`, else `info`: one of `debug`, `info`,
`warn`, `error`. An invalid `--log-level` is a usage error; an invalid `STUDY_LOG` is
ignored with a warning. In `study mcp`, nothing but MCP messages is ever written to stdout,
and stderr shows only warnings and errors whatever the level.
